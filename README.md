# Welcome to Graph Club!

This repo collects talks on Graphs and Networks, hackathon exercises and some written solutions as produced in our tri-weekly Wednesday meet-ups.

We also scribble down some ideas about how Graph Club might work and develop below, drawing from the open working document [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XHu3lMfH5F-N7Q8INch1s_R2fN3yXIMmf18NkDGsjmQ/edit?usp=sharing) _(MOJ Digital Google account holders)_.

## What's it all about?

Graph Club aims to:

* Introduce new users to the magic of graphs and encourage self-learning;
* Develop, share and enjoy skills in graph/network analysis through standalone 1-hour hackathons;
* Self-organise and learn how to arrange a hackathon and punchy group activities.

It **doesn't** aim to:

* Produce authoritative or novel material on graph theory;
* Provide extensive training on graph theory and analysis;
* Induce a groan or panic on seeing calendar reminders.

A good hackathon, we reckon, has these qualities:

* Anyone can join any session, at any stage in their learning;
* Everyone has a go, whoever they are;
* Everyone learns something, whatever it is;
* Some people can solve each problem, within the session time;
* One or more people present their work, however far they got.

## Cool! How can I get involved?
