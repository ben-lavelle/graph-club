# 2 - Graph Neural Networks

> This was a presentation session led by Jo Li-How-Cheong on 25 November 2020

> :video_camera:  For internal MOJ staff the session recording is available [here](https://justiceuk-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/benjamin_lavelle_justice_gov_uk/EauDmFWrKKRBt9mRmjoypGIBLKfTzIOG0-KFINq2Sf6vgg?e=Ar2WFP).

Jo talked through her DS Masters' thesis on Graph Neural Networks, which focused on an implementation of the Patchy-San CNN for Graphs.
She talked through the differences between graph-derived features in a learning model and graphs *as* features supplied to the model.

She provided the following post-session links:

* List of [Open-Source GNN Projects](https://awesomeopensource.com/projects/graph-neural-networks);
* The [Deep Graph Library](https://www.dgl.ai/pages/start.html) project (Jo: "This was one of the libraries I tried but wasn't flexible enough for my problem - seems like the website has changed so it might be a lot better by now!");
* A detour into [Semi-Supervised Learning](https://awesomeopensource.com/project/yassouali/awesome-semi-supervised-learning), which is touched on in the talk, and finds many applications in graph-based learning.
* The [PSCN](https://github.com/tvayer/PSCN) project, a Python implementation of the Patchy-San CNN, which Jo adapted for her work.
