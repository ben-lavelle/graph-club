# Spies !!! 👀


This is the folder with the material of the 3rd Session of the MOJ Graph Club

called  `metrics, measures, and clustering`

You can find:


- a presentation (soon)
- code in Python and R on how to visualise an undirected graph
- code on how to calculate various node centralities in networkx and communicate them via plots
- code on how to calculate edge measures of interest (such as edge betweness)
- some memes 🤦‍♂️
