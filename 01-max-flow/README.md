**A Max Flow / Min Cut problem in the US Postal Service, Georgia**

> This interactive hackathon was presented by Ben Lavelle on 10 November 2020

> :books: Slides for the introductory part of this presentation are available to internal MOJ colleagues [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ancdjn1r4nuOVyvuHSeIzr2UkBrMZ49-wM30hIVZf9Q/edit?usp=sharing), which also include some introductory notes on graphs and flow problems (but you can do the task without them!).

Put yourself (with some imagination) in the shoes of voting rights activist [Stacey Abrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacey_Abrams), trying to maximise the availability of postal votes for voters in the 2020 Georgia senate race. How can you increase flow through the tricky US Postal Network? 

This session introduces Graphs as flow networks and the canonical max-flow problem.
We also touch on the notion of duality and the famous min-cut/max-flow duality problem.

Written solutions and improvements welcome, particularly a good layout for this graph.
